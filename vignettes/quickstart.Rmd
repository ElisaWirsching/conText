# Preliminaries

**conText** was designed to work closely with [quanteda](https://quanteda.io), as such most functions will expect a quanteda object such as a _corpus_, _tokens_ or _dfm_/_fcm_. To make the most of **conText**, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with some of quanteda's basic functionalities [Quick Start Guide](https://quanteda.io/articles/quickstart.html).

# Setup

## Installing the package

Since **conText** is not _yet_ available on CRAN you will need to install it directly from GitHub.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("prodriguezsosa/conText")
```

## Load package

```{r, message=FALSE}
library("conText")
```

# Data

To use **conText** you will need three datasets: 

1. A (quanteda) **corpus** with the documents and corresponding document variables (covariates) you want to evaluate.
2. A set of (GloVe) **pre-trained embeddings**.
3. A **transformation matrix** specific to the pre-trained embeddings.

The **conText** package includes two sample corpora `cr_sample_corpus` --a sample of the U.S. Congressional Records (Sessions 111th - 114th)-- and `anes2016_sample_corpus` --a sample of the ANES 2016 open-ended question on "most important issues facing the country"--; a subset of [Stanford NLP's](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) 300-dimensional GloVe embeddings, `glove_subset`; and a transformation matrix ,`khodakA`, computed by [Khodak et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05388) for the aforementioned GloVe 300-dimensional embeddings (see documentation for details). For the following guide we will be using the full versions of these datasets which we've made available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6dfr3i6no6nzvm0/AADqk6HFTvZJGNyu3FuO62kGa?dl=0).

## Load data

```

## Pre-processing

```{r, message = FALSE}

# tokenize corpus
toks <- tokens(cr_corpus, remove_punct=T, remove_symbols=T, remove_numbers=T, remove_separators=T)

# clean out stopwords and words with 2 or fewer characters
toks_nostop <- tokens_select(toks, pattern = stopwords("en"), selection = "remove", min_nchar=3)

# only use features that appear at least 5 times in the corpus
feats <- dfm(toks_nostop, tolower=T, verbose = TRUE) %>% dfm_trim(min_termfreq = 5) %>% featnames()

# leave the pads so that non-adjacent words will not become adjacent
toks <- tokens_select(toks_nostop, feats, padding = TRUE)
```

# The building blocks of `a la carte` embeddings

## 1. Identify the relevant contexts

Suppose we are interested in the semantics surrounding the word _immigration_ in the U.S. Congress during the Obama years (sessions 111th - 114th). We begin by identifying all instances of the **target** term --_immigration_-- in our corpus and, for each instance, store it's context-- the N words (N = 6 in this example) preceding and following the instance. We can do this in one step using the `conText::tokens_context` function. Notice, both the input, `x`, and the output are a quanteda `tokens-object`. Moreover, each document in `immig_toks` --tokens of a context around an instance of _immigration_-- inherits the document variables (`docvars`) of the document from whence it came and can be retrieved using `docvars`.

```{r, message = FALSE}
# build a corpus of contexts sorrounding the target term "immigration"
immig_toks <- tokens_context(x = toks, pattern = "immigration", window = 6L)
```

## 2. Build a document-feature-matrix

Given a set of tokenized contexts, we next build it's corresponding document-feature-matrix, namely a matrix where each row represents a given document's vector of feature counts. We do this using quanteda's [`dfm`](https://quanteda.io/reference/dfm.html) function.

```{r, message = FALSE}

# create document-feature matrix
immig_dfm <- dfm(immig_toks)
immig_dfm[1:3,1:3]
```

## 3. Build a document-embedding-matrix

Given a `dfm`, a set of pre-trained embeddings, and a corresponding transformation matrix, we can proceed to embed each document (context) `a la carte`. We embed any given document by multiplying each of it's feature counts with its corresponding pre-trained feature-embedding, column-averaging the resulting vectors, and multiplying by the transformation matrix. This "transforms" a _sparse_ V-dimensional vector (a vector of feature counts, with V = number of features in the corpus) into a _dense_ D-dimensional vector (a D-dimensional embedding, with D = dimensions of pre-trained embeddings). We do this using `conText::dem`--`dem` standing for _document-embedding-matrix_. Keep in mind, only those features that appear in the set of pre-trained embeddings will be used in computing a document's embedding. Documents with no features overlapping with the pre-trained provided are dropped. 

`conText::dem`--`dem` outputs a `dem-class` object which is similar in many ways to `dfm-class` object. Importantly, a `dem-class` object inherits all the `docvars` from the `dfm` used to compute it (except those of documents that could not be embedded). Additionally, a `dem-class` object will store other useful attributes, including the names of the documents that were embedded and the vector of features used. 

```{r, message = FALSE}

# create document-embedding matrix using a la carte
immig_dem <- dem(x = immig_dfm, pre_trained = glove_wvs, transform = TRUE, transform_matrix = khodakA, verbose = TRUE)

## each embedding document is associated with it corresponding docvars
#head(immig_dem@docvars)

## you can check which documents were not embedded due to lack of overlapping features (in this example all documents are embedded)
## note: `quanteda` functions like `docvars()` and `docnames()` don't work on `dem` objects, so you will have to call the attributes directly. 
#setdiff(docnames(immig_dfm), immig_dem@Dimnames$docs)

## vector of features used to create the embeddings
#head(immig_dem@features)
```

## 4. Average over document embeddings

We now have an ALC embedding for each context of `immigration` in our Congressional Record corpus. To get a single embedding for immigration, we can simply take the column-average. 

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# to get a single "corpus-wide" embedding, take the column average
immig_wv <- matrix(colMeans(immig_dem), ncol = ncol(immig_dem)) %>%  `rownames<-`("immigration")
dim(immig_wv)
```

However, we are usually interested in exploring semantic differences across groups. To do so, we can average within a grouping variable defined by one or a combination of the `docvars`. We do this using `conText::dem_group` (very similar in flavor to quanteda's [`dfm_group`](https://tutorials.quanteda.io/basic-operations/dfm/dfm_group/)). This results in an `a la carte` embedding of `immigration` for each group.

```{r, message = FALSE}
# to get group-specific embeddings, average within party
immig_wv_party <- dem_group(immig_dem, groups = immig_dem@docvars$party)
dim(immig_wv_party)
```

## 5. Comparing group embeddings

### Nearest neighbors

Given each party's embeddings, we can proceed to do some exploratory analysis. First, we can evaluate differences in nearest neighbors --features with the highest cosine-similarity with each group embedding-- using `conText::nns()`. We can use the `candidates` argument to limit the set of features we want `nns` to consider as candidate nearest neighbors. In this example we limit candidates to those features that appear in our corpus by setting  `candidates = immig_wv_party@features` (otherwise, any word in the set of pre-trained embeddings can be a candidate).

```{r}

# find nearest neighbors by party
# setting as_list = TRUE outputs a list with a separate tibble for each group
nns(immig_wv_party, pre_trained = glove_wvs, N = 5, candidates = immig_wv_party@features, as_list = FALSE)
```

### Cosine similarity

We may be interested in exploring the relationship between each group's embedding of `immigration` and a specific set of features. For example, how does each party's understanding of immigration compares on the "reform" vs. "enforcement" dimension. To answer this, we use `conText::cos_sim()`. Results (on this limited sample of the data) suggest Democrats are more prone to speak of "reform" in the context of "immigration" whereas Republicans are more likely to speak of "enforcement".

```{r}
# compute the cosine similarity between each party's embedding and a specific set of features
cos_sim(immig_wv_party, pre_trained = glove_wvs, features = c('reform', 'enforcement'), as_list = FALSE)
```

### Nearest neighbors cosine similarity ratio

A third exploratory function included in `conText` is `nns_ratio`. Given two group embeddings (`x`) and a set of candidates nearest neighbors (`candidates`), `nns_ratio` computes the ratio of cosine similarities between group embeddings and features. If `N` is defined, this ratio is computed for union of the top `N` nearest neighbors. This ratio is useful to identify features that are most "discriminant" of each party. You can use the `numerator` argument to define which group's embedding to set as the numerator in this ratio. Below we set `numerator = "R"`, so features with values greater than $1$ identify features that are more "discriminant" of Republican contexts of immigration (i.e. the cosine similarity between the those features and the Republican embedding is greater than their cosine similarity with the Democrat embedding). Similarly, features with values lower than $1$ identify features that are more "discriminant" of Democrat contexts of immigration.

```{r}
# compute the cosine similarity between each party's embedding and a specific set of features
nns_ratio(x = immig_wv_party, N = 10, numerator = "R", candidates = immig_wv_party@features, pre_trained = glove_wvs, verbose = FALSE)
```

## Multiple Keywords

In the above example we had one keyword, `immigration`. However, we can also explore the semantics of multiple keywords simultaneously, including phrases! We simply provide a vector of patterns in the `pattern` argument of `tokens_context`.

```{r, message = FALSE}
# build a corpus of contexts sorrounding the target term "immigration"
mkws_toks <- tokens_context(x = toks, pattern = c("immigration", "welfare", "immigration reform", "economy"), window = 6L, verbose = FALSE)

# create document-feature matrix
mkws_dfm <- dfm(mkws_toks)

# create document-embedding matrix using a la carte
mkws_dem <- dem(x = mkws_dfm, pre_trained = glove_wvs, transform = TRUE, transform_matrix = khodakA, verbose = FALSE)

# get embeddings for each pattern
mkws_wvs <- dem_group(mkws_dem, groups = mkws_dem@docvars$pattern)

# find nearest neighbors for each keyword
mkws_nns <- nns(mkws_wvs, pre_trained = glove_wvs, N = 5, candidates = mkws_wvs@features, as_list = TRUE)

# to check results for a given pattern
mkws_nns[["immigration reform"]]
```

This can also be useful if we wanted to explore _group differences_ in the semantics of a given "topic" where we define a topic by a vector of keywords. Note, these "topical" embeddings are computed off of the collection of contexts around the set of pattern words provided. So, in the example below, the contexts around each of `"immigration"`, `"immigrant"` and `"immigration reform"` are treated as a single collection of contexts for the purposes of computing each group's embedding.

```{r, message = FALSE}
# build a corpus of contexts sorrounding the immigration related words
topical_toks <- tokens_context(x = toks, pattern = c("immigration", "immigrant", "immigration reform"), window = 6L, verbose = FALSE)

# create document-feature matrix
topical_dfm <- dfm(topical_toks)

# create document-embedding matrix using a la carte
topical_dem <- dem(x = topical_dfm, pre_trained = glove_wvs, transform = TRUE, transform_matrix = khodakA, verbose = FALSE)

# get "topical" embeddings for each party
topical_wvs <- dem_group(topical_dem, groups = topical_dem@docvars$party)

# find nearest neighbors for each keyword
nns(topical_wvs, pre_trained = glove_wvs, N = 5, candidates = topical_wvs@features, as_list = FALSE)
```

# Wrapper functions

The above functions give users a lot of flexibility, however, it can be cumbersome to write each step every time one wants to do some exploratory analysis on a corpus. In this section we'll look into a collection of wrapper functions that allow users to go straight from `corpus` to results. Each of the three exploratory functions `nns`, `cos_sim` and `nns_ratio` has its own wrapper function. 

An added advantage of the wrapper functions is that they make it easy to obtain standard errors around the sample statistics of interest via _bootstrapping_. Bootstrapping works by sampling with replacement contexts from our corpus of contexts (within group if `groups` is specified) and going through the above steps for each of our exploratory analysis functions (i.e. computing an `a la carte` embedding on each bootstrapped sample, then computing the cosine similarities etc.). Let's start with `conText::get_nns`, a wrapper function to compare nearest neighbors between groups. 

### Nearest neighbors

We will use the same tokenized corpus of "immigration" contexts --`immig_toks` as above and again limit candidates nearest neighbors to the set of features in our corpus. To group by `party` we set `groups = docvars(immig_corpus, 'party')`. If no grouping variable is provided, the full set of (tokenized) contexts are aggregated into one single embedding. To estimate standard errors for the cosine similarities between each party's embedding and their corresponding nearest neighbors we set `bootstrap = TRUE` and define the desired number of bootstraps with `num_bootstrap`. Notice the output now has an additional column `std.error`. This is simply the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of cosine similarities obtained via bootstrapping. Note, values may differ slightly to the step-by-step process outlined above as they represent averages over bootstrapped samples.

```{r, message = FALSE}

# we limit candidates to features in the corpus
feats <- featnames(dfm(immig_toks))

# compare nearest neighbors between groups
set.seed(2021L)
immig_party_nns <- get_nns(x = immig_toks, N = 10,
        groups = docvars(immig_toks, 'party'),
        candidates = feats,
        pre_trained = glove_wvs,
        transform = TRUE,
        transform_matrix = khodakA,
        bootstrap = TRUE,
        num_bootstraps = 10, 
        as_list = TRUE)

# nearest neighbors of "immigration" for Republican party
immig_party_nns[["R"]]
```

### Cosine similarity

`conText::get_cos_sim` is a wrapper function for `cos_sim`, used to evaluate how similar each group's embedding is to a set of features of interest. We use the same immigration corpus as above and again set `bootstrap = TRUE` to obtain standard errors for the cosine similarities.

```{r, message = FALSE}

# compute the cosine similarity between each group's embedding and a specific set of features
set.seed(2021L)
get_cos_sim(x = immig_toks,
            groups = docvars(immig_toks, 'party'),
            features = c("reform", "enforce"),
            pre_trained = glove_wvs,
            transform = TRUE,
            transform_matrix = khodakA,
            bootstrap = TRUE,
            num_bootstraps = 10,
            as_list = FALSE)
```

### Nearest neighbors cosine similarity ratio

Finally, `conText::get_nns_ratio()` is a wrapper function for `nns_ratio`, used to gauge how discriminant nearest neighbors are of each group embedding by using the ratio of cosine similarities. Unlike `get_nns` and `get_cos_sim`, a binary `groups` argument must be provided. To control which group to use as the numerator in this ratio, we use the `numerator` argument. As before, we limit the candidate nearest neighbors to the set of local features that meet our desired count threshold and set `bootstrap = TRUE` to get standard errors, in this case of the cosine similarity ratios.

Finally, `get_nns_ratio` allows us to make inferences using a permutation test, specifically around the absolute deviation of the observed cosine similarity ratios from $1$ (this captures how discriminant a given nearest neighbor is). Specifically, for each permutation, the grouping variable is randomly shuffled and the absolute deviation of the cosine similarity ratios from $1$ is computed. The empirical p.value is then the proportion of these deviations that are larger than the observed deviation. 

The output of `get_nns_ratio` contains three additional columns (relative to `nns_ratio`) if `bootstrap = TRUE` and `permute = TRUE`. These are the standard errors around the cosine similarity ratios, the corresponding (empirical) `p.value` and  a `group` variable identifying which group the nearest neighbor belonged to -- `shared` means it appeared in both groups' top $N$ nearest neighbors.

```{r, message = FALSE}

# compute ratio
set.seed(2021L)
immig_nns_ratio <- get_nns_ratio(x = immig_toks, 
              N = 10,
              groups = docvars(immig_toks, 'party'),
              numerator = "R",
              candidates = feats,
              pre_trained = glove_wvs,
              transform = TRUE,
              transform_matrix = khodakA,
              bootstrap = TRUE,
              num_bootstraps = 10,
              permute = TRUE,
              num_permutations = 10,
              verbose = FALSE)

head(immig_nns_ratio)
```

**conText** also includes a plotting function specific to `get_nns_ratio()`, providing a nice visualization of its output. `alpha` defines the desired significance threshold to denote "significant" results on the plot. Also, you can choose between two different visualizations of the same results using the `horizontal` argument.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot_nns_ratio(x = immig_nns_ratio, alpha = 0.01, horizontal = TRUE)
```

```{r out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
# outputs better in knitr than R-generated images
knitr::include_graphics('https://github.com/prodriguezsosa/conText/blob/develop/vignettes/nns_ratio.png')
```

# Embedding regression

The above framework allows us to explore semantic differences over a given grouping variable. However, we may want to control for other covariates and, perhaps more importantly, speak to the uncertainty surrounding observed differences. In [Rodriguez, Spirling and Stewart (2021)](https://github.com/prodriguezsosa/EmbeddingRegression) we show how `a la carte` embeddings can be used within a regression-framework that allows us to perform statistical inference using embeddings. To do so we use the function `conText::conText()`. The data must be a quanteda corpus with covariates stored as document variables (`docvars`). 

First we specify the formula consisting of the target word of interest, _immigration_ and the set of covariates --this follows a similar syntax as R's `lm()` and `glm()` functions. To use all covariates in the corpus' docvars simply specify `immigration ~ .`. Similarly, if you want to embed the full documents rather than a specific target word, specify `. ~ party + gender`. Finally, the target argument can also be a phrase, simply wrap it in quotations -- e.g. `"immigration reform" ~ party + gender`. Covariates must either be binary indicator variables or discrete variables that can be transformed into binary indicator variables e.g. a character or factor variable with three states will be automatically transformed by `conText()` into two separate indicator variables with one "baseline" state that is excluded from the regression.

Keep in mind, `conText()` calls on `corpus_context()`, so you do not need to create a corpus of contexts before running it, simply provide it with the original corpus and `conText()` will find all instances of the target word along with their respective contexts.

```{r, message = FALSE}
set.seed(2021L)
model1 <- conText(formula = immigration ~ party + gender,
                  data = toks,
                  pre_trained = glove_wvs,
                  transform = TRUE, transform_matrix = khodakA,
                  bootstrap = TRUE, num_bootstraps = 10,
                  stratify = TRUE,
                  permute = TRUE, num_permutations = 100,
                  window = 6, case_insensitive = TRUE,
                  verbose = FALSE)
```

`conText()` outputs a `conText-class` object which is simply a `dgCMatrix class` matrix corresponding to the beta coefficients (embeddings) with additional attributes including: a table with the normed coefficients (excluding the intercept), their std. errors and p-values, `@normed_coefficients` (see [Rodriguez, Spirling and Stewart (2021)](https://github.com/prodriguezsosa/EmbeddingRegression) for details), and the set of features used when creating the embeddings `@features`. 

Notice, we can combine the coefficients to compute the ALC embeddings for the various combinations of the covariates. 

```{r, message = FALSE}

# D-dimensional beta coefficients
# the intercept in this case is the ALC embedding for female Democrats
# beta coefficients can be combined to get each group's ALC embedding
DF_wv <- model1['(Intercept)',] # (D)emocrat - (F)emale 
DM_wv <- model1['(Intercept)',] + model1['gender_M',] # (D)emocrat - (M)ale 
RF_wv <- model1['(Intercept)',] + model1['party_R',]  # (R)epublican - (F)emale 
RM_wv <- model1['(Intercept)',] + model1['party_R',] + model1['gender_M',] # (R)epublican - (M)ale 

# nearest neighbors
nns(rbind(DF_wv,DM_wv), N = 10, pre_trained = glove_wvs, candidates = model1@features)
```

We can also access and plot --using `plot_conText()`-- the normed coefficients.

```{r, message = FALSE}
model1@normed_cofficients
```

# Local GloVe and transformation matrix
  
  If (a) you have a large enough corpus to train a full GloVe embeddings model and (b) your corpus is distinctive in some way --e.g. a collection of articles from scientific journals--, then you may want to consider estimating your own set of embeddings and transformation matrix. The first step is to estimate GloVe embeddings on the full corpus which you will then use as your pre-trained embeddings. 

## Estimate GloVe embeddings

This example is taken (with minor changes) from [this quanteda vignette](https://quanteda.io/articles/pkgdown/replication/text2vec.html) on computing GloVe embeddings using `quanteda` and `text2vec`.

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(text2vec)

#---------------------------------
# estimate transform
#---------------------------------

# tokenize
cr_toks <- tokens(cr_corpus)

# only use features that appear at least 5 times in the corpus
feats <- dfm(cr_toks, verbose = TRUE) %>%
  dfm_trim(min_termfreq = 5) %>%
  featnames()

# leave the pads so that non-adjacent words will not become adjacent
cr_toks <- tokens_select(cr_toks, feats, padding = TRUE)

# construct the feature co-occurrence matrix
cr_fcm <- fcm(cr_toks, context = "window", window = 6, count = "frequency", tri = FALSE)

# estimate glove model using text2vec
glove <- GlobalVectors$new(rank = 300, 
                           x_max = 10,
                           learning_rate = 0.05)
wv_main <- glove$fit_transform(cr_fcm, n_iter = 10,
                               convergence_tol = 1e-3, 
                               n_threads = RcppParallel::defaultNumThreads())


wv_context <- glove$components
cr_glove_wvs <- wv_main + t(wv_context) # word vectors

# qualitative check
find_nns(cr_glove_wvs['immigration',], pre_trained = cr_glove_wvs, N = 5, candidates = feats)
```

## Estimating the transformation matrix

Given a corpus and it's corresponding GloVe embeddings, we can compute a corresponding transformation matrix using `conText::compute_transform()`.

```{r, message = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# compute transform
cr_transform <- compute_transform(x = cr_fcm, pre_trained = cr_glove_wvs, weighting = 100)
```

Below we provide a couple of sanity checks to make sure the computed transformation matrix produces sensical results.

```{r, message = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
#---------------------------------
# check
#---------------------------------

# create document-embedding matrix using our locally trained GloVe embeddings and transformation matrix
immig_dem_local <- dem(x = immig_dfm, pre_trained = cr_glove_wvs, transform = TRUE, transform_matrix = cr_transform, verbose = TRUE)

# take the column average to get a single "corpus-wide" embedding
immig_wv_local <- colMeans(immig_dem_local)

# find nearest neighbors for overall immigraiton embedding
find_nns(immig_wv_local, pre_trained = cr_glove_wvs, N = 10, candidates = immig_dem_local@features)

# we can also compare to corresponding pre-trained embedding
sim2(x = matrix(immig_wv_local, nrow = 1), y = matrix(cr_glove_wvs['immigration',], nrow = 1), method = 'cosine', norm = 'l2')
```

# Other

## Feature embedding matrix

We can use a feature-co-occurrence matrix to simultaneously embed multiple features. This can be useful to (1) compare two corpora along multiple features simultaneously and/or (2) estimate context-specific feature embeddings that can subsequently be fed into a downstream classification task. We'll focus on (1) here. First, we remove stop-words and low-frequency features from our tokenized corpus. Notice, we set `padding = TRUE` here to avoid making non-adjacent words adjacent prior to computing the embeddings. We then compute a separate `fcm` for each group (`party` in our case).

```{r, message = FALSE}

# tokenize texts
cr_toks <- tokens(cr_corpus)

# clean out stopwords
cr_toks_nostop <- tokens_select(cr_toks, pattern = stopwords("en"), selection = "remove")

# only use features that appear at least 5 times in the corpus
feats <- dfm(cr_toks_nostop, tolower=T, verbose = TRUE) %>% dfm_trim(min_termfreq = 5) %>% featnames()

# leave the pads so that non-adjacent words will not become adjacent
cr_toks <- tokens_select(cr_toks_nostop, feats, padding = TRUE)

# create feature co-occurrence matrix for each party (set tri = FALSE to work with fem)
cr_fcm_D <- fcm(cr_toks[docvars(cr_toks, 'party') == "D",], context = "window", window = 6, count = "frequency", tri = FALSE)
cr_fcm_R <- fcm(cr_toks[docvars(cr_toks, 'party') == "R",], context = "window", window = 6, count = "frequency", tri = FALSE)
```

Given an `fcm` for each group, we can proceed to compute a corresponding "feature-embedding-matrix" for each group.

```{r, message = FALSE}

# compute feature-embedding matrix
cr_fem_D <- fem(cr_fcm_D, pre_trained = glove_wvs, transform = TRUE, transform_matrix = khodakA, verbose = FALSE)
cr_fem_R <- fem(cr_fcm_R, pre_trained = glove_wvs, transform = TRUE, transform_matrix = khodakA, verbose = FALSE)

# cr_fem will contain an embedding for each feature
cr_fem_D[1:5,1:3]
```

Finally, we can use the `conText::feature_sim` function to compute "horizontal" cosine similarities between both `fem`s for the set of overlapping features. The output of `feature_sim` is ranked from least similar to most similar features.

```{r, message = FALSE}
feat_comp <- feature_sim(x = cr_fem_R, y = cr_fem_D)

# least similar features
head(feat_comp)

# most similar features
tail(feat_comp)
```

## Embedding full documents

In all of examples above we've focused on contexts defined as "windows" around a target word. In  [Rodriguez et al. (2021)](https://github.com/prodriguezsosa/EmbeddingRegression) we show that the same procedure works well on contexts defined as the full document, as long as the full document is relatively short. We discuss the example of analyzing open-ended responses to ANES 2016 question: "what are the most important issues facing the country?". Instead of embedding contexts around a given target word, we embed each full open-ended response and average over respondent ideology.

```{r, message = FALSE}

# ANES 2016 open-ends on most important issues facing country
anes2016 <- readRDS(paste0(path_to_data, 'anes2016.rds')) %>% select(response, ideology, gender) %>% na.omit()

# build corpus
anes2016_corpus <- corpus(anes2016$response, docvars = anes2016[,c('ideology', 'gender')])

# tokenize corpus
toks <- tokens(anes2016_corpus, remove_punct=T, remove_symbols=T, remove_numbers=T, remove_separators=T)

# clean out stopwords and words with 2 or fewer characters
toks_nostop <- tokens_select(toks, pattern = stopwords("en"), selection = "remove", min_nchar=3)

# only use features that appear at least 5 times in the corpus
feats <- dfm(toks_nostop, tolower=T, verbose = TRUE) %>% dfm_trim(min_termfreq = 5) %>% featnames()

# leave the pads so that non-adjacent words will not become adjacent
toks <- tokens_select(toks_nostop, feats, padding = TRUE)

# create document-feature matrix
anes2016_dfm <- dfm(toks)

# create document-embedding matrix using a la carte
anes2016_dem <- dem(x = anes2016_dfm, pre_trained = glove_wvs, transform = TRUE, transform_matrix = khodakA, verbose = FALSE)

# group by ideology
anes2016_wv_ideology <- dem_group(x = anes2016_dem, groups = anes2016_dem@docvars$ideology)

# check nearest neighbors
anes_nns <- nns(x = anes2016_wv_ideology, pre_trained = glove_wvs, N = 5, candidates = anes2016_wv_ideology@features, as_list = TRUE)

# check nns for Conservatives
anes_nns[["Conservative"]]
```

Recall we can run most of the code above by simply calling `get_nns` directly on the corpus.

```{r, message = FALSE}

# compare nearest neighbors between groups
anes_nns2 <- get_nns(x = toks, N = 10,
        groups = docvars(toks, 'ideology'),
        candidates = feats,
        pre_trained = glove_wvs,
        transform = TRUE,
        transform_matrix = khodakA,
        bootstrap = TRUE,
        num_bootstraps = 10, 
        as_list = TRUE)

anes_nns2[["Conservative"]]
```

To run a regression on the full document rather than a specific target word use the `.~` operator.

```{r, message = FALSE}
set.seed(2021L)
model1 <- conText(formula = . ~ ideology + gender,
                  data = toks,
                  pre_trained = glove_wvs,
                  transform = TRUE, transform_matrix = khodakA,
                  bootstrap = TRUE, num_bootstraps = 10,
                  stratify = TRUE,
                  permute = TRUE, num_permutations = 100,
                  window = 6, case_insensitive = TRUE,
                  verbose = FALSE)
```
